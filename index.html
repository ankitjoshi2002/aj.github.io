                <h3>DDoS Attack Detection</h3>
                <p>This project leverages machine learning (ML) algorithms, specifically K-means and K++ means, to analyze network traffic data and detect anomalous patterns indicative of DDoS activity.
                Using machine learning is to develop and deploy an intelligent system capable of identifying and mitigating DDoS attacks in real-time.
                By applying these algorithms to large datasets of network traffic, the system can identify patterns and behaviors that are characteristic of DDoS attacks, allowing for accurate and timely detection.
                The project aims to accurately detect anomalous patterns indicative of DDoS activity.</p>

                <h3>Virtual Calculator (Computer Vision)</h3>
                <p>To design and develop an innovative virtual calculator that uses computer vision technology to recognize hand gestures and perform calculations, making mathematical operations more engaging and accessible.
                This project combines the power of computer vision and Python programming to create a unique calculator that can detect and interpret hand gestures, allowing users to input numbers and operators using simple hand movements. 
                The system will then perform the desired calculations and display the results in real-time.</p>
